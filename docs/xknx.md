# [](#header-1)The XKNX Object

# [](#header-2)Overview

The `XKNX()` object is the core element of any XKNX installation. It should be only initialized once per implementation. The XKNX object is responsible for:

* connectiong to a KNX/IP device and managing the connection
* processing all incoming KNX telegrams
* organizing all connected devices and keeping their state
* updating all connected devices from time to time
* keeping the global configuration

# [](#header-2)Initialization

```python
xknx = XKNX(config='xknx.yaml',
            own_address=Address,
            address_format=GroupAddressType.LONG
            telegram_received_cb=None,
            device_updated_cb=None,
            rate_limit=DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT)
```

The constructor of the XKNX object takes several parameters:

* `config` defines a path to the local [XKNX.yaml](/configuration).
* `own_address` may be used to specify the physical KNX address of the XKNX daemon. If not speficied it uses `15.15.250`.
* `address_format` may be used to specify the type of group addresses to use. Possible values are:
** FREE: integer or hex representation
** SHORT: representation like '1/34' without middle groups
** LONG: representation like '1/2/34' with middle groups
* `telegram_received_cb` is a callback which is called after every received KNX telegram. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
* `device_updated_cb` is an async callback after a [XKNX device](#devices) was updated. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
* `rate_limit` in telegrams per second - can be used to limit the outgoing traffic to the KNX/IP interface. The default value is 20 packets per second.

# [](#header-2)Starting

```python
async with xknx.run(state_updater=False,
                 connection_config=None):
    pass
```

This is the context manager that controls XKNX's main loop. It will search for KNX/IP devices in the network and either build a KNX/IP-Tunnel or open a mulitcast KNX/IP-Routing connection. `start()` takes the following parameters
* if `state_updater` is set, XKNX will start an asynchronous process for syncing the states of all connected devices every hour
* `connection_config` replaces a ConnectionConfig() that was read from a yaml config file.

```python
await xknx.start(state_updater=False,
                 daemon_mode=False,
                 connection_config=None)
```

`xknx.start()` will search for KNX/IP devices in the network and either build a KNX/IP-Tunnel or open a mulitcast KNX/IP-Routing connection. `start()` takes the following parameters

* if `state_updater` is set, XKNX will start an asynchronous process for syncing the states of all connected devices every hour
* if `daemon_mode` is set, start will only stop if Control-C is pressed. This function is useful for using XKNX as a daemon, e.g. for using the callback functions or using the internal action logic.
* `connection_config` replaces a ConnectionConfig() that was read from a yaml config file.

`xknx.start()` is a legacy method. Consider using an async context manager
using `xknx.run()` instead.

Using `xknx.run()`, the equivalent of `daemon_mode` is achieved with a
body that does nothing:

```python
async with xknx.run():  # only interested in side effects
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(99999)
```

# [](#header-2)Stopping

```python
await xknx.stop()
```

Will disconnect from tunneling devices and stop the different queues.

This is a legacy method. Consider using `async with xknx.run():` which will
call `stop` for you when your code leaves its body, even if your code is
interrupted with ^C or terminates due to an exception.

# [](#header-2)Devices

The XKNX may keep all devices in a local storage named `devices`. All devices may be accessed by their name: `xknx.devices['NameOfDevice']`. If XKNX receives an update via KNX GROUP WRITE the device is updated automatically.

Example:

```python
switch = Switch(xknx,
                name='TestSwitch',
                group_address='1/1/11')
xknx.devices.add(switch)

await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_on()
await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_off()
```


# [](#header-2)Callbacks

The `telegram_received_cb` will be called for each KNX telegram received by the XKNX daemon. Example:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX

async def telegram_received_cb(telegram):
    print("Telegram received: {0}".format(telegram))

async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(telegram_received_cb=telegram_received_cb)
    await xknx.start(daemon_mode=True)
    await xknx.stop()

# pylint: disable=invalid-name
asyncio.run(main())
```

For all devices stored in the `devices` storage (see [above](#devices)) a callback for each update may be defined:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX
from xknx.devices import Switch


async def device_updated_cb(device):
    print("Callback received from {0}".format(device.name))


async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(device_updated_cb=device_updated_cb)
    switch = Switch(xknx,
                    name='TestSwitch',
                    group_address='1/1/11')
    xknx.devices.add(switch)

    await xknx.start(daemon_mode=True)

    await xknx.stop()

# pylint: disable=invalid-name
asyncio.run(main())
```
